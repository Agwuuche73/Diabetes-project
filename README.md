# Diabetes-project



## Problem Statement
Diabetes is a significant and growing health challenge within the Pima Indian population, with a high rate of occurrence among young and middle-aged adults. Despite the availability of health data, the community lacks:
Accessible visual tools to interpret trends
Clear identification of the most impactful risk factors
Real-time insights to inform policy and medical decisions
This project addresses the need for a comprehensive, visual analytics solution that explores:
How different health indicators correlate with diabetes outcomes
Which age groups are most affected
What interventions could be prioritized based on these findings 
By solving this problem, the dashboard empowers stakeholders to take proactive, data-informed actions to reduce the incidence and impact of diabetes.
