### Problem Statement

Diabetes is a growing public health concern, particularly in certain populations with elevated risk factors. The Pima Indian community has historically shown high rates of diabetes. However, understanding the key drivers of diabetes onset, such as:
- Elevated glucose levels
- High body mass index (BMI)
- Increased blood pressure
- Age distribution of cases

  
…is essential to designing targeted health interventions and preventive care strategies.
The problem is the lack of accessible, visual, and actionable analysis that links these medical indicators to diabetes outcomes in this specific population.


### Project Objective

To analyze health-related variables (such as glucose, BMI, blood pressure, insulin levels) among the Pima Indian population in order to:
- Identify patterns and trends related to diabetes prevalence.
- Compare diabetic vs non-diabetic individuals based on key medical metrics.
- Support early detection and intervention through data-driven insights.
- Create a visual dashboard for stakeholders (e.g., healthcare providers, researchers, public health officials) to easily interpret findings and make informed decisions.


### Data source: 

Medicare Reimbursement Data by State (2014)[Download here] (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nancyalaswad90/review)

### Conclusions & Recommendations

- High Risk Among Young Adults: The data shows a concerning diabetes rate in younger adults (20–40). Early screening and intervention strategies should target this demographic.
- BMI & Glucose as Indicators: Elevated BMI and glucose levels are strong indicators of diabetes, emphasizing the need for lifestyle and dietary interventions.
- Preventative Programs: With over a third of the population diabetic, there’s a clear need for preventative healthcare programs, especially focused on weight management, exercise, and glucose monitoring.
- Data Validation Tip: Verify the BMI/Glucose trend line chart—it seems to show decreasing values with diabetic outcome, which may be misleading based on the other visuals.
